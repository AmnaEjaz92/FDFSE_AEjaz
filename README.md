STATEMENT ABOUT THE CLASS AND ME

- What is the reason why you decided to take the class?
  
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UD, I am working on exoplanets with Dr. Dodson-Robinson since last year. My research work relies on data analysis and statistical methods, I've not taken any courses during my grad school which cover these areas. I was mostly learning this stuff on my own. I was looking for such a relevant course where I could learn the basics of data analysis and statistics. I found the course description very relevant to my research interests which is why I signed up for it. 

- What do you hope to learn the most?

I hope to learn Bayesian analysis, probability distributions, and regression methods. On the computational side, I'm hoping to improve my Python skills specifically data handling and manipulation.

- What are the strengths in your background and character that you think will help you in the class?

I have some experience in Python coding and also machine learning specifically neural networks that I think will be helpful in this class.
